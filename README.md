## Features
- Open a CSV file

## Start the program

You will need Java 11 JDK to run this program. 

Double click the `file_analyzer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar` file in the `target` folder to start the program. 
You can also find the jar file in the release.

If that doesn't work, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```
java -jar target/file_analyzer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
```
